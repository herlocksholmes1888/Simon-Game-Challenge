# Simon-Game-Challenge
A website created to train the use of jQuery, created due to Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp. You can play it [here](https://herlocksholmes1888.github.io/Simon-Game-Challenge/)

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ON MOBILE! I'm still figuring out how to make it work with touchscreens and I haven't discovered how to test it on my computer yet, so some commits are buggy. I'll figure it out at some point, though.
